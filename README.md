## The Premise
* This is a DM for a Dungeons and Dragons Campaign. Ideally, this will:

  * Keep track of a story and keep it consistent
  * Keep track of players stats and do a milestone/xp system for level up
  * Take care of combat and enemies

Each campaign will be unique, while being able to dynamically update the current campaign according to how the players act
**Sounds Like Something An AI would do**

I want this bot to be focused more on roleplaying and immersiveness

*More dialog, less game actions based on the player's actions*


## How It Works
